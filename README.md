**Version 1.0.1**
Code and samples of the html structure and a css stylesheet of the third "Probleamtica Semanal" from the Become a software developer course. In this code i design and create a bran new newspapper web page, I create from scratch the structure of that web page with the basics html and add format with the css styling lenguage. The main concern was the use of media queries and Flexbox Css to make a responsive design of the web page. That means tha the newspaper could be renderize from a cellphone, a table or a desktop. One of the determinate things i wich i focused was the internalization of the so called "Buenas Pr√°cticas" of the both css and html coding, these good practices suchs as proxily, coherence and adaptability are not strictly requiered to be a programer but neccesary to be a good programer and make individual and group work more efficient.
