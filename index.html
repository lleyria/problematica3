                Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve in which two teams of five players compete to collectively destroy a large structure defended by the opposing team known as the "Ancient", whilst defending their own. As in Defense of the Ancients, the game is controlled using standard real-time strategy controls, and is presented on a single map in a three-dimensional isometric perspective. Ten players each control one of the game's 119 playable characters, known as "heroes", with each having their own design, strengths, and weaknesses. Heroes are divided into two primary roles, known as the core and support.

                            The Fall Season Update in Dota 2 is about more than just a new ranked season. It also brought updates to Dota Plus and Guilds, along with sharing details about Valve’s plans for the rest of 2020 and beyond.  Valve are going to try a new approach to MMR resets. The MMR reset will be optional, and for those who want to participate.
